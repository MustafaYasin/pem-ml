# RoboVolley

RoboVolley is a multi-agent game implemented with ML-Agent in Unity. In this project we have built robot arm agents that learns to control its six axes correctly to play volleyball against each other. The Agents were trained with both cooperative and competitive strategies by using reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of cooperative strategy is preventing the ball fall on the ground and play with each other as long as possible. In contrast, when trained with competitive strategy, the individual agent aims to win the game and behaves more aggressively. For detecting the placement of ball and controlling the game episode, Collider and trigger are added to corresponding sceneâ€™s objects. Which agent starts, will be chosen interchangeably and the ball will be started at a random position within the correct side.
